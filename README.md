# DigitRecognizer
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 

In my submission, I have implemented a neural network with 3 layers (input, hidden, output), from scratch. I tried to implement the concepts I learnt in ANdrew NG's course on Machine Learning. The Jupyter notebook contains all the necessary details for understanding my solution. My submission got a score of 90% on Kaggle.
